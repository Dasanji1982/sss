            <abstract>

                <p>Regulation of the p73 gene is complex due to the presence of two promoters and the very complex mRNA maturation in both the N-terminal and C-terminal parts of the protein. We have found an additional regulation mechanism for the p73-<italic>&#x3B1;</italic> form that occurs through proteolytic cleavage connected to the activity of the serine protease HtrA2. Following apoptotic stimuli, HtrA2 accumulates in the nucleus and cleaves p73<italic>&#x3B1;</italic> in the C-terminal portion, enabling the protein to increase its transactivation activity on the apoptotic gene bax but not on the cell-cycle regulator gene p21. In the presence of HtrA2, p73 is more prone to cause caspase activation and nuclei fragmentation: p73 needs HtrA2 to activate and enhance its apoptotic functions. This new relation between p73 and HtrA2 may help to understand the different behavior of the p73 protein in cell physiology and in the responses of cancer cells to chemotherapy.</p>

        <p>p73 is a transcription factor belonging to the p53 family, together with p63.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref></sup> It shares a high degree of sequence homology with p53 and can bind to DNA in a sequence-specific manner in the promoters presenting p53-responsive elements, activating the transcription of p53 target genes involved in cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref></sup> All family members have three protein domains: an N-terminal transactivation domain, a central DNA-binding domain (DBD) and a C-terminal oligomerization domain.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref></sup> The 5&#x2032; portion of the gene has two transcription initiation sites that can generate transactivation-proficient (TA) proteins or proteins lacking the TA domain but containing an extra exon (exon 3&#x2032;) not present in full-length proteins: N-terminus deficient (DN) isoforms.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref></sup> The TAp73 isoforms exert transcriptional activity, whereas the DNp73 variants, lacking the transactivation domain, cannot directly induce gene expression and do not induce apoptosis or cell-cycle arrest.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref></sup> The main role of N-truncated isoforms is regulatory activity, since they exert a dominant-negative effect on p53 and TAp73 by blocking their transactivating activity to induce cell growth arrest or cell death.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref></sup> However, most of the changes in the p73 gene generated by alternative splicing occurs at the C-terminus. There are at least six different isoforms, from <italic>&#x3B1;</italic> to <italic>&#x3B7;</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref></sup> The C-terminus of the <italic>&#x3B1;</italic>-isoform of p63 and p73 contains the sterile <italic>&#x3B1;</italic>-motif domain.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref></sup> The relative amounts of p53, TAp73 and DNp73 are thought to be involved in determining cell death and cell-cycle arrest or cell proliferation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref></sup> The p73 steady-state protein levels seem to define the role of p73 protein members in tumorigenesis and it would therefore be very useful to identify proteins to control their steady-state levels.</p>
        <p>High temperature requirement A (HtrA2) is a mammalian serine protease that resides in the mitochondria of healthy cells, but apoptotic stimuli cause it to be released into the cytoplasm, where it binds the inhibitor of apoptotic proteins (IAPs).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref></sup> This results in proteolytic degradation of these inhibitor proteins and in the following activation of the caspase cascade mechanism. HtrA2 is also involved in caspase-independent cell death through its serine protease activity exerted directly on specific targets.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref></sup></p>
        <p>There is evidence linking HtrA2 to p53. In particular, HtrA2 may help in determine some of the proapoptotic functions of p53. The proposed mechanism passes through a p53-mediated increase in HtrA2 transcriptional levels, which would increase the degradation of IAPs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref></sup></p>
        <p>Here we provide evidence that HtrA2 is also linked to p73. However, p73 does not directly activate HtrA2 transcription. Rather, HtrA2, through its serine protease activity, can cleave p73 in the C-terminus, leading to a truncated protein with increased apoptotic function. This suggests a new mechanism of activation of p73 apoptotic functions.</p>

                <title>HtrA2 cleaves p73 <italic>in vitro</italic></title>
                <p>Starting from data on p53,<sup>19</sup> we verified whether p73 could also induce HtrA2 mRNA expression after transfection. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1a</xref>, neither TA nor DN p73 isoforms promoted HtrA2 mRNA expression in H1299 non-small-cell lung carcinoma cells. In the same experimental conditions, p53 also had no effect on HtrA2 expression. As a control, we verified the induction of p21 mRNA after transfection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1a</xref>) and the effective expression of transfected p53 and p73 isoforms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1b</xref>). Transfection of TAp73<italic>&#x3B1;</italic>, p53 or DNp73<italic>&#x3B1;</italic> did not enhance HtrA2 protein levels in these cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1c</xref>). Furthermore, the p53 downregulation by siRNA failed to modulate HtrA2 expression in both untreated and doxorubicin-treated conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1d</xref>). In these experiments, however, expression of transcription-proficient p73 isoforms promoted the release of HtrA2 from the mitochondria to the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1e</xref>). Coexpression of p73 and HtrA2 resulted in the appearance of new bands at lower molecular weight (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1f</xref>). This prompted us to further analyze the interaction between p73 and HtrA2, to see whether this serine protease could directly cleave p73 isoforms. We synthesized six radiolabelled [<sup>35</sup>S]-p73 isoforms, including four C-terminal TA one (TAp73<italic>&#x3B1;</italic>, TAp73<italic>&#x3B2;</italic>, TAp73<italic>&#x3B3;</italic> and TAp73<italic>&#x3B4;</italic>) and two C-terminal DN isoforms (DNp73<italic>&#x3B1;</italic> and DNp73<italic>&#x3B2;</italic>). Only TAp73<italic>&#x3B1;</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2a</xref>) and DNp73<italic>&#x3B1;</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2b</xref>) were cleaved when incubated with HtrA2 <italic>in vitro</italic>.</p>
                <p><italic>In vitro</italic> synthesized radiolabelled [<sup>35</sup>S]-TAp73<italic>&#x3B1;</italic> was incubated with increasing amounts of wild-type HtrA2 or a proteolysis-defective mutant, S306A HtrA2. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2c</xref>, only wild-type HtrA2 cleaved TAp73<italic>&#x3B1;</italic>. This effect was specific for HtrA2 since it was not seen with the proteolysis-defective mutant. These results indicate that the part of protein present only in the <italic>&#x3B1;</italic>-isoforms is likely to contain an amino-acid sequence recognized by HtrA2.</p>
                <p>To confirm the potential cleavable site in a specific domain of the p73 protein, we incubated different <italic>in vitro</italic> synthesized radiolabelled [<sup>35</sup>S]-p73 domains with recombinant HtrA2, using the N-terminal domain (NTD), the DBD and the C-terminal domain (CTD) as illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2d</xref>. In agreement with previous experiments, only the CTD was cleaved when incubated with recombinant HtrA2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2g</xref>). The other domains (NTD and DBD) were not cleaved when incubated with the serine protease under the same experimental conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2e and f</xref>).</p>

                <title>HtrA2 cleaves p73 in cells</title>
                <p>To investigate whether p73 was also cleaved in cells, we cotransfected TAp73<italic>&#x3B1;</italic> and HtrA2 in the H1299 cell line. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3a</xref>, lane 5, HtrA2 cleaved TAp73<italic>&#x3B1;</italic> in cells. However, in accordance to the <italic>in vitro</italic> data, catalysis-defective HtrA2 was unable to induce TAp73<italic>&#x3B1;</italic> fragmentation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3a</xref>, lane 6). The next step was to confirm that HtrA2 could cleave p73 in the CTD. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3b</xref> shows that cotransfection of the different plasmids expressing NTD, DBD and CTD domains with the HtrA2-encoding plasmid resulted in the cleavage only of CTD, confirming the <italic>in vitro</italic> findings. We then investigated whether the S306 HtrA2 mutant could compete for the cleavage site on p73. We cotransfected different ratio of mutant HtrA2/wild-type HtrA2 together with a fixed amount of TAp73<italic>&#x3B1;</italic>. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3c</xref>, the mutant clearly competed with the wild-type HtrA2 on the cleavage site on TAp73<italic>&#x3B1;</italic> and at the highest doses completely wrong-footed the wild type.</p>
                <p>As HtrA2 can bind the IAPs promoting their degradation, we checked whether caspases were directly implicated in p73 cleavage cotransfecting TAp73<italic>&#x3B1;</italic> and HtrA2 with or without the pan-caspase inhibitor Z-vad-fmk. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3d</xref> shows that Z-vad-fmk did not affect HtrA2's activity on p73, ruling out any direct caspase activity on p73 cleavage. The effect of Z-vad-fmk treatment was assessed by measuring caspase-3 and caspase-7 activity in a fluorimetry-based assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3e</xref>).</p>

                <title>HtrA2 and p73 interact in the nucleus</title>
                <p>A recent work by Kuninaka <italic>et al.</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref></sup> reported that HtrA2 serine protease can be present in the nucleus. Since p73 is a nuclear transcriptional factor, we tested whether HtrA2 could in fact be present in this compartment in our system too. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4A</xref> indicates that in unstressed conditions HtrA2 is not found in the nucleus but, after doxo treatment, it did appear there, in the same compartment as p73. We then checked the presence of HtrA2 in the nucleus by confocal microscopy, confirming its presence only after drug treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4B</xref>, slide g). In addition, spots of colocalization between HtrA2 and p73 in the nucleus after doxo treatment were found (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4B</xref>, slide h). The last results prompted us to further analyze the possible <italic>in vivo</italic> interaction between p73 and HtrA2 by co-immunoprecipitation experiments. Data presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4C</xref> clearly show that HtrA2 and p73<italic>&#x3B1;</italic> co-immunoprecipitate in cells when overexpressed while p73<italic>&#x3B2;</italic> did not. We then checked if p73 and HtrA2 could interact at endogenous level in the nucleus. Only after doxo treatment, HtrA2 enters in the nucleus, as demonstrated in confocal experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4B</xref>), and co-immunoprecipitates with p73 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4D</xref>).</p>

                <title>Endogenous p73 is cleaved by HtrA2 and endogenous HtrA2 cleaves p73</title>
                <p>To investigate whether HtrA2 cleaved endogenous p73, we overexpressed wild-type HtrA2 in H1299 cells and analyzed the cleavage of the target protein by western blot. The exogenous HtrA2 led to the appearance of a low-molecular-weight band, indicating that endogenous TAp73<italic>&#x3B1;</italic> was effectively cleaved in the presence of active HtrA2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4E</xref>).</p>
                <p>We also tested whether endogenous HtrA2 cleaved synthesized radiolabelled [<sup>35</sup>S]-TAp73<italic>&#x3B1;</italic> <italic>in vitro</italic>, by incubating the radiolabelled [<sup>35</sup>S]-TAp73<italic>&#x3B1;</italic> with mitochondria extract from wild-type and HtrA2-knockout mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEFs). Only the incubation of radiolabelled [<sup>35</sup>S]-TAp73<italic>&#x3B1;</italic> with wild-type HtrA2 mitochondria resulted in p73 cleavage (compare lanes 2 and 4 of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4F</xref>). MEF treatment with doxo 2&#x2009;<italic>&#x3BC;</italic>M for 24&#x2009;h resulted in the release of HtrA2 (and cytochrome <italic>c</italic>) from the mitochondria into the cytosol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4G</xref>). As a consequence of this physiological process, mitochondria extract from treated cells contained less HtrA2 than untreated cells (compare lanes 3 and 4 of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4G</xref>). Incubation of radiolabelled [<sup>35</sup>S]-TAp73<italic>&#x3B1;</italic> with mitochondria from treated cells resulted in slightly less p73 cleavage than with mitochondria from untreated cells (compare lanes 3 and 2 of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4F</xref>).</p>
                <p>Additional proof linking the serine protease HtrA2 and the transcriptional factor p73 comes from the analysis of p73 endogenous basal levels in HtrA2-knockout murine MEFs. In these cells, which have no HtrA2 activity, basal levels of p73 were higher than in wild-type MEFs, clearly suggesting a correlation between HtrA2 and p73 and, when HtrA2 was present, TAp73<italic>&#x3B1;</italic> levels were lower (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4H</xref>). To verify the presence of a p73 lower-molecular-weight band in wild-type MEFs, we loaded SDS-PAGE with 10 times more proteins and in this forced condition we detected the processed form of TAp73<italic>&#x3B1;</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4I</xref>).</p>

                <p>We then investigated the functional role of the cleavage process exerted by HtrA2 on p73 and, in particular, if the cleavage of p73 could result in different regulation on p73-responsive genes. To answer this question, we checked basal promoter activity on four classical p73 downstream genes: the cell-cycle regulator p21, the apoptosis inducer bax, the E3-ubiquitine ligase mdm2 and the angiogenic factor vegf. The luciferase assay clearly indicated that the basal activity of bax promoter was lower in HtrA2-knockout MEFs than in HtrA2 wild-type MEFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5A</xref>). The basal activity of the others promoter, p21, mdm2 and vegf, was comparable in HtrA2 wild-type and HtrA2-knockout MEFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5B&#x2013;D</xref>). These results indicated that HtrA2 was important for bax induction. Furthermore, bax (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5</xref>, box a), p21 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5</xref>, box b) mdm2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5</xref>, box c) and vegf (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5</xref>, box d) protein levels correlated with the activity of their respective promoters.</p>

                <p>Previous results indicated a possible correlation between the HtrA2 and bax. To establish whether p73 might be one of the possible links, we performed a series of transient transfections in the p53-deficient H1299 cell line. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Figure 6a</xref> shows that cotransfection of HtrA2 with p73 enhanced the production of bax mRNA compared with p73 transfection alone (compare columns 5 and 3). Transfection of the dominant-negative p73DD interfered with the bax mRNA induction. The contemporary presence of p73DD with p73 and HtrA2 blocked the bax upregulation (column 8) showed previously (column 5). Panel b of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Figure 6</xref> shows the expression of p21 mRNA under the same experimental conditions as in panel a. Cotransfection of p73 and HtrA2 (column 5) did not enhance the expression of p21 compared with p73 transfection alone. As a control of the HtrA2 activity, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Figure 6c</xref> shows the HtrA2-mediated cleavage of p73. We also checked whether p73DD could be cleaved, and hence inactivated, by HtrA2. The amount of p73DD did not seem to decrease in the presence of HtrA2, suggesting that the function of the dominant-negative form was preserved. In the same cellular system, regulation of bax and p21 at mRNA and protein levels after HtrA2 downregulation by siRNA was investigated. As expected, the downregulation of HtrA2 resulted in downregulation of bax at both mRNA and protein levels, whereas the expression of p21 was not modified (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Figure 6d and e</xref>).</p>

                <p>The next step was to verify whether the endogenous HtrA2 could enhance the activity of p73 on bax (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Figure 7a</xref>). Transfection of p73 in HtrA2 wild-type MEFs resulted in an increase of bax mRNA detected by real-time PCR (column 2). Cotransfection of the dominant-negative p73DD with the transcription-proficient p73 reduced this effect (column 4). In HtrA2-knockout MEFs, bax transcription was not induced after p73 transfection (compare columns 6 and 2). In this cell line, the induction of bax transcription was comparable to the situation in which p73 was cotransfected together with the dominant-negative p73DD in HtrA2 wild-type MEFs (compare columns 6 and 4). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Figure 7b</xref> shows how p21 was regulated in the same experimental conditions as for bax analysis. Transfection of p73 in both cell lines, HtrA2 wild-type and knockout-knockout MEFs, resulted in the same p21 mRNA induction (compare columns 2 and 6), indicating that the presence or absence of HtrA2 had negligible effect. Cotransfection of the dominant-negative p73DD caused comparable reductions of p21 mRNA transcription in both HtrA2 wild-type and HtrA2-knockout MEFs (compare columns 4 and 8).</p>

                <title>HtrA2 activity is necessary to stimulate p73-dependent apoptosis</title>
                <p>The last step was to determine whether the increase of the apoptotic gene <italic>bax</italic> increased cell death. We investigated the activation of caspases 3 and 7 in a fluorimetry-based assay. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Figure 7c</xref> reports the results: doxo treatment of HtrA2 wild-type MEFs for 6&#x2009;h activated caspase 3 and 7 (column 3). Transfection of the dominant-negative p73DD 24&#x2009;h before doxo treatment reduced caspase activity (compare columns 3 and 4).</p>
                <p>As expected, the same experiment conducted in HtrA2-knockout MEFs did not show any difference in caspase 3/7 activity when drug treatment alone was compared with doxo treatment plus p73DD transfection (compare columns 7 and 8). Caspase activity in HtrA2-knockout doxo-treated MEFs (both with or without p73DD) was comparable with the activity in HtrA2 wild-type MEFs treated with the drug and transfected with p73DD. These results support the idea that p73 can induce caspase activation and that HtrA2 activity is important for p73 activity (compare columns 7 and 8 with column 4).</p>
                <p>We then checked whether caspase activation induced fragmentation of the nuclei, using DAPI/sulfurodamine B staining and microscope counting. The experimental conditions were the same as in the previous experiment, except that drug treatment was extended for 48&#x2009;h. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Figure 7d</xref> basically confirms that caspase activation showed in the previous experiment resulted in nuclei fragmentation and that the amount of activity was related to the amount of cell death. As previously shown for caspases, after drug treatment, apoptosis increased (column 3) more than when cells were transfected with p73DD before drug treatment (compare column 4 with column 3) in HtrA2 wild-type MEFs. Similarly, in HtrA2-knockout MEFs, the presence or the absence of the dominant-negative p73DD did not change the levels of apoptosis, which were comparable with the level in HtrA2 wild-type MEFs transfected with dominant-negative p73 before treatment (compare columns 7 and 8 with column 4).</p>

            <title>Discussion</title>
            <p>p73, a member of the p53 family, is a protein regulated by several complex mechanisms.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref></sup> The p73 gene contains two independent promoters that can regulate the expression of proteins with different behavior: TA promoter (P1) drives the expression of TA isoforms that induce cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis, whereas DN promoter (P2) controls the production of DN isoforms that have oncogenic features.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref></sup> In addition to the two promoters, the products of transcription can be spliced in a variety of isoforms (form <italic>&#x3B1;</italic> to <italic>&#x3B6;</italic>) with different specificity and transcriptional activity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref></sup> The <italic>&#x3B1;</italic>-isoform contains an inhibitory domain in its C-terminal portion in fact, and the <italic>&#x3B2;</italic>-form that lacks this part of the protein is a more powerful transcription factor.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref></sup></p>
            <p>We have characterized a new activation mechanism based on removal of the extreme C-terminal part of the p73 <italic>&#x3B1;</italic>-isoform. This cleavage creates a new form of p73 with peculiar characteristics. HtrA2, a member of the family of heat-shock endoproteases defined by bacterial HtrA, can cleave p73<italic>&#x3B1;</italic> in the C-terminal part of the protein. The other p73 isoforms (<italic>&#x3B2;</italic>, <italic>&#x3B3;</italic> and <italic>&#x3B4;</italic>) were not cleaved by HtrA2. HtrA2 targets many proteins such as IAPs,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref></sup> HAX1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref></sup> and ped/pea15<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref></sup> for their proteolysis. Here, for the first time, we have characterized a new role for HtrA2. The activity of HtrA2 is not necessary to eliminate a substrate, but it is needed to activate a new function of a substrate through elimination of one portion. <italic>In vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>, HtrA2-cleaved p73<italic>&#x3B1;</italic> in the C-terminal part. The proteolysis-inactive mutant was unable to cleave p73, but did compete for the cleavage site on the target site on p73. In our hands, the cleavage of p73 was completely independent of caspase activation; in fact, inhibition of caspases activation with Z-vad-fmk pretreatment did not interfere with p73 cleavage in cells. Although HtrA2 is mainly localized in mitochondria, after stress we detected accumulation of HtrA2 in the nuclear compartment, where it can cleave p73. Colocalization of p73 and HtrA2 could be detected in the nucleus by confocal microscopy and by co-immunoprecipitation experiment. The finding that in two isogenic systems, the physiological levels of full-length p73<italic>&#x3B1;</italic> were higher in HtrA2-knockout MEFs than in wild-type MEFs seems to confirm that p73 is differently regulated in the two systems and that the HtrA2-mediated cleavage of p73 occurs in physiological conditions. In coherence with this, increasing amounts of proteins loaded into an SDS-PAGE indicated a lower-molecular-weight band detected by the anti-p73 antibody in an extract from HtrA2 wild-type MEFs. The cleavage of TAp73<italic>&#x3B1;</italic> mediated by HtrA2 influences the activation of p73 downstream genes.</p>
            <p>As a paradigm, we showed that HtrA2-cleaved p73 preferentially activated a proapoptotic gene such as bax, whereas the activation of a cell-cycle arrest-inducing gene, p21, was not affected. This in turn increased p73-dependent apoptosis. This mechanism, observed after cell damage, offers an additional strategy for the regulation of p73-dependent apoptosis and might be used to modulate this activity in cancer cells after chemotherapy. Despite the effects on apoptosis seem to be quite specific, we also investigated the induction of cell-cycle-specific arrest and the appearance of a senescence-like phenotype without observing any effect (data not shown). Experiments to identify the precise site of cleavage of HtrA2 are in progress. Analysis of the sequence of the p73 C-terminus showed several potential cleavage sites. The literature, however, indicates that HtrA2 can cleave different sequences making any assumption, based on the peptide sequence, difficult. The reported evidence indicates that the cleavage involves removal of the inhibitory domain in the C-terminal portion of the p73<italic>&#x3B1;</italic> isoform, which exerts general inhibitory activity on the protein's transcription capacity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref></sup> The presence of HtrA2 and p73 in cells and possibly the formation of the cleaved form of p73 is important for caspase activation and apoptosis too. Without p73 or HtrA2, the levels of caspase activation and apoptosis levels were lower than in situations in which both proteins were present.</p>
            <p>In conclusion, our findings indicate that the activity of TAp73<italic>&#x3B1;</italic> on bax regulation needs to be stimulated through HtrA2 cleavage in the protein's C-terminal portion. The study also shed light on a novel activation mechanism of p73 that should be considered in cells that seem to show defects in apoptosis. Finally, it will be interesting to further analyze the role of HtrA2 in the cleavage of the N-terminal truncated form of p73<italic>&#x3B1;</italic>, which could have implications in the TAp73/DNp73/p53 regulatory loop.</p>
