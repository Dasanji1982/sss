<sectitle>Summary</sectitle>
<p>Studies in mice suggest that antagonizing miRNA-21 could potentially lower cardiac fibrosis and treat cardiovascular disease. Myocardial miRNA-21 was upregulated in three different mouse models of cardiac failure and in patients with end-stage heart failure compared with what was seen in healthy controls. An antagomir targeting miRNA-21 lowered cardiac fibrosis, cardiomyocyte size and heart weight and improved cardiac function in two different mouse models of cardiac failure compared with what was seen in mice that received saline control. Further studies in larger animal models of heart failure are necessary to determine the therapeutic efficacy of an antagomir approach to silencing miRNA-21.</p>
